1. Of the Trigonall SECTOR: The deſcription and uſe thereof.

    _ Thus much of the deſcription of the Inſtrument and its parts: Now of the uſe thereof.

    _ To finde the quantity of any angle.

    _ Two angles being known, to repreſent any Rightlined Triangle.

    _ To repreſent any Rectangular Triangle.

    _ To repreſent any obtuſe angular Triangle.

    _ To repreſent any Acuteangular Triangle.

    _ To find the Content of any of theſe Triangles.

    _ To reduce the Area of a Triangle found of one denomination, to a perpendicular and baſis of another denomination.

    _ Thus hath been ſhewed its uſe in the reſolution of Triangles, and in working proportions.

    _ To find the length of the Tangent line of any degree, to a Radius of 10000.

    _ And thus by proportion, may be found the length of the Tangent line for any degree even unto 90 gr.

    _ To find the length of a Secant for any degree.

    _ To find the length of a line of ſines for any degree.

    _ To find the length of a line of Chords for any degree.

    _ To find a line or number in continuall proportion, having two numbers given

    _ Having the Square and its Root to find the Cube thereof.
